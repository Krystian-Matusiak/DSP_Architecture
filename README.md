## Digital Signal Processor (DSP) Architecture

The aim of these classes was to obtain knowledge related to digital signal processing, algorithms permformed on STM32, some computer vision issues and introduction to neural networks.




### Technology stack

During these classes the following tools have been used:
*   C
*   STM32
*   Python
*   OpenCV
*   TensorFlow

## Laboratories 1 - warm-up

The purpose of this classes was to get familiar with STM32CubeIDE and basics of HAL. That's why I will skip the details

## Laboratories 2 - ADC

During these laboratories I had to measure the sine signal from external device - Analog Discovery 2 of Digilent. Those signal had to be generated with different frequency.

<div align="center">
    <img src="./README_IMG/ADC_1k.png" width="70%">
</div>

Then fast Fourier transform (FFT) had to be perfomed for those signals. The task was to observe the aliasing effect - when the signal's frequency is higher than the half of the sampling freqency

    <img src="./README_IMG/FFT_ADC_1k.png" width="50%">
</div>
<div align="center">
    <img src="./README_IMG/FFT_ADC_10k.png" width="50%">
</div>

ADC was also performed for simple ADC and through the DMA module. Moreover DMA helped to perform oversampling which resulted in better Effective number of bits (ENOB):

<div id="image-table">
    <table>
        <tr>
            <td>Simple ADC</td>
            <td>ADC with DMA and oversampling</td>
        </tr>
	    <tr>
    	    <td>
                <img src="./README_IMG/FFT_ADC_10k.png" />
      	    </td>
            <td>
                <img src="./README_IMG/FFT_DMA_10k.png"  /> 
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</div>

## Laboratories 3 - DAC

In this exercise there was a need to generate sine wave from look-up table (LUT).

![Alt text](./README_IMG/1kHz.png)

Moreover Direct digital synthesis (DDS) method has been implemented. Thanks to this it was possible to gneerate sine wave with any frequency (of course the higher frequency the more deformated sine wave is). For frequency f=1kHz:

![Alt text](./README_IMG/TIME_1kHz.png)

For frequency f=10kHz:

<!-- ------------------------------------------------- -->

## Laboratories 4 - Modulations

The aim of these classes was to implement amplitude modulation (AM) and frequency modulation (FM). Both modulation were easy to implement thanks to the DDS algorithm from previous classes. The main idea is to provide carrier wave which is modulated according to modulating wave.


### Amplitude modulation AM

For this case amplitude of carrier wave changes according to the values of modulating signal:

![Alt text](./README_IMG/FM_STFT.png)


### Frequency modulation FM

In turn, in this case the only difference is that the frequency of carrier wave will be changed;

## Laboratories 5 - Filters

During this task I had to implement Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) filter, and more precisely lowpass and bandpass filter. IIR filter is base on feedback - historical input and output are taking part in final result.

</div>


### Lowpass filter

Lowpass filter has been implemented for frequency f=4kHz. The amplitude characteristics are as follows:

![Alt text](./README_IMG/OUT_4k.png)
![Alt text](./README_IMG/OUT_6k.png)



### Bandpass filter

This filter had to be implemented to work with $f_{1} = 500Hz$ and $f_{2} = 2kHz$:

</div>
<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

<!-- ------------------------------------------------- -->

## Laboratories 6 - Heartbeat signal processing


Input signal was a heartbeat signal of mother and her baby. The task was to fitler them and separate them (with the use of python). The FFT of this signal is as follows:
<div align="center">
    <img src="./README_IMG/Freq_unfiltered.png" width="70%">
</div>

If we filter first, second and third harmonic we can obtain child heartbeat signal. Butterworth bandpass filter has been used. I also applied heartpy lib which was responsible for determining heart rate. On the left side we can see filtered signal and on the right side there is unfiltered signal:
<div align="center">
    <img src="./README_IMG/BPM.png" width="90%">
</div>

### Pan-Tompkins algorithm

To verify the results Pan-Tompkins algorithm has been implemented and applied. This algorithm is very common used in ECG. To perform such method there is a need to do the following steps:
*   use bandpass filter
*   perform derivative of the signal
*   square the signal
    <div align="center">
        <img src="./README_IMG/squared.png" width="50%">
    </div>
*   apply moving window integrator
    <div align="center">
        <img src="./README_IMG/moving_average.png" width="50%">
    </div>
*   find peaks
    <div align="center">
        <img src="./README_IMG/find_peaks.png" width="50%">
    </div>

## Laboratories 7 - OpenCV

This exercise consist of 2 tasks - implement code for:
*   face recognition
*   cars' license plates detection

During these tasks openCV has been used.

### Face recognition

To complete this task pretrained cascade classifier has been used - Haar feature-based cascade classifier:
<div align="center">
    <img src="./README_IMG/haarFace.png" width="65%">
</div>

The result of this classifier:
<div align="center">
    <img src="./README_IMG/faces.png" width="65%">
</div>

### Cars' license plates detection

This task was a little bit more difficult. Several image processing methods have to be performed. Original image:
<div align="center">
    <img src="./README_IMG/original.png" width="50%">
</div>

*   gray out:
    <div align="center">
        <img src="./README_IMG/grayed.png" width="50%">
    </div>

*   blurring:
    <div align="center">
        <img src="./README_IMG/blurred.png" width="50%">
    </div>

*   apply Canny edge detector
    <div align="center">
        <img src="./README_IMG/canny.png" width="50%">
    </div>

Thanks to those edges there is a possibility to find contours:
<div align="center">
    <img src="./README_IMG/all_edges.png" width="50%">
</div>

For now we need to find closed contour with the highest area:

<div id="image-table">
    <table>
	    <tr>
    	    <td>
                <img src="./README_IMG/plate_car1.png" />
      	    </td>
            <td>
                <img src="./README_IMG/plate_car2.png"  /> 
            </td>
            <td>
                <img src="./README_IMG/plate_car4.png"  /> 
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</div>

## Laboratories 8 - Perceptron

In this task there was a need to analyze the principle of operation of single perceptron. At first I had to implement 1-layer 1-neuron perceptron and use this model
to solve the problem of regression. Dataset have been initialized:

<div align="center">
    <img src="./README_IMG/train_test_data.png" width="75%">
</div>

Then our perceptron has been implemented. It has one layer of one neuron
because it is sufficient for training linear function. Then I trained model on training data
for various parameters.
Two cases have been compared, where the first one checks Adam optimizer and the
second one SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) optimizer, both for mean absolute
error. Those cases have been checked for different learning rates. The findings are as
follows:


<div align="center">
    <img src="./README_IMG/LR_MAE_Adam.png" width="75%">
</div>


<div align="center">
    <img src="./README_IMG/LR_MAE_SGD.png" width="75%">
</div>

We can notice that both algorithms work inversely â€“ Adam needs higher learning
rate to obtain better results while SGD seems to be destabilized for higher learning
rate.
I also checked both optimizers for mean square error as a loss function but I remain
mean absolute error as a metric just to be able to compare those methods. For SGD the results
are not even interpretable because Iâ€™ve optained error of $10^{32}$. For Adam case the plot
is as follows:
<div align="center">
    <img src="./README_IMG/LR_MSE_SGD.png" width="75%">
</div>

Adam optimizer seems to be the best choice for this kind of problem. Then I've checked the results with respect to the number of epochs:

<div align="center">
    <img src="./README_IMG/epochs_check.png" width="75%">
</div>

As we can see for the best case (learning rate $lr=0.1$) 500 epochs are sufficient. The plot for the best case:

<div align="center">
    <img src="./README_IMG/MSE_ADAM_LR0_1.png" width="75%">
</div>

The weights of this neuron can be interpreted as a coefficients of linear function:
$$ y_{exact}  = 3*X + 100$$

$$ y_{pred}  = 2.98*X + 51.07$$

As we can see there is a huge difference for bias. Even if I provide additional
learning rate and more epochs the difference for bias will be still visible. But If we provide lower noise we can get more accurate bias due to the fact that standard deviation will be lower.

I also checked if it's possible to approximate square function

$$ {\left\lbrack \matrix{X^2 \cr X \cr 1} \right\rbrack} $$

The results are as follows:

<div align="center">
    <img src="./README_IMG/square_not_good.png" width="75%">
</div>
